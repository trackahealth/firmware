# TrackaHealth Firmware Repository

This repository will support future hardware development for **TrackaHealth** – bringing low-cost, portable diagnostic tools to rural clinics and remote communities.

## 🩺 Purpose
- Build firmware for portable health devices  
- Enable offline data collection in areas without power or internet  
- Support open-source hardware development  

## 📦 What We’re Building Toward
- Portable vitals monitors  
- Low-cost diagnostic tools  
- Devices that work without internet or electricity  

## 🌍 Why It Matters
In many parts of Nigeria and Africa, access to basic health technology is limited.  
By creating open-source hardware and firmware, we aim to change that – one device at a time.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Contributing
